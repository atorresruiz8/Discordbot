# Discordbot
A basic starting point for a Discord bot coded using Python.

For this code to work, you need to create a .env file that contains two variables: DISCORD_TOKEN for the token associated with your bot, and SERVER_MOD_ROLE for the role that verifies if a user is a moderator in your server.
